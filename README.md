# Awesome Tokyo [![Awesome][awesome-badge]][awesome-link] [![Travis Status][travis-badge]][travis-link]

> All about your stay in Tokyo, where to go: how to get around.

This year our event will be in [3331 - Arts Chiyoda](https://goo.gl/maps/RMeTkrxaAyjkZhRn7).

## ‚òâ Surroundings

We prepared a map this year that contains a lot of layers. **Hotels**, Restaurants, Activities, and more that might interest you in the area. Please have a closer look: [‚Üí üó∫](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EHjtxICBFoB_QKSJC9fPTEi-AP2wm_Hl&usp=sharing)

## üîÜ Important Tips

+ **Book Ahead!** - Booking hotels in Tokyo at the last minute can be challenging. Plan early to ensure you have a place to stay.
+ **Have a Visa!** - By japanese law, you need to be able to identify yourself at all times with a passport and you need to have a valid visa. When in please, carry your passport on you safely. Many countries have a [visa excemption](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html) which means you will receive your visa upon embarkation in the airport. In more complex cases, please contact us after looking at: http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/
+ **Have Cash!** - Foreign credit cards are problematic at many ATM's and sometimes at shops. Having backup-cash on you makes things easier. _(ATMs at "7/11 - seven eleven" convenience stores usually work)_
+ **No tipping!** - There is no tipping in any situation in Japan _(cabs, restaurants, personal care, etc.)_
+ **Power adapters!** - Japan has 100V! plugs that resembler North american plugs. ([more info](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2225.html)).
+ _To Consider:_ **an emergency document** - As long as everything is fine, Japan is wonderful but how to be prepared in case an issue arises? Here is a template by Martin with several notes: [üö® Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15F9Z7fF1wOM3lGxAm7z9w-oqVemRnjzXODo3fv0KobU/edit#heading=h.pbkypg6742)

## üå§ Weather & üß• Clothes

Average November/December weather in Tokyo<br/>
**High** - 13 C, 55.4 F<br/>

November and December are pretty cool, but usually not that rainy. Please bring warm clothes. If you need an umbrella you can buy one at most convenience stores for 500-600 yen. Some traditional hotels _(Ryokan)_ are for authenticity purpose not well insulated and it can be quite chill in the rooms. 

## üì± Mobile Wifi/SIM 

Japan has a strong mobile internet network, and for tourist use it is possible to get both tourist SIM cards as well as rent mobile Wifi boxes. You can either pick up at the airport and/or preorder it to be sent to your Hotel.

## :raised_hands: To event organizers

The purpose of curating something in Tokyo is to help people find great places to eat and hack because we could not find these things easily when we attended foreign conferences before. We would like to help a lot of people have safe and fun travel throughout the curated list. On the other hand, the list is not enough because we cannot customize it for each conference, but we think you may not want to create the list from scratch, so we prepare following steps to do it. Have a fun!

1. Fork the project.
2. Change name for your event. E.g. `awesome-jsconf-2020`
3. Customize forked list :sparkles: :
   + Add venues address
   + List hotels near venues
