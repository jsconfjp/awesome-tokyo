### Where to eat and drink

In Japan, we use [Tabelog](https://tabelog.com/en/) and [yelp](https://www.yelp.com/%E6%9D%B1%E4%BA%AC) to find places to eat and drink. However, Tabelog is more popular than yelp. You can use Tabelog in English, Chinese and Korean. Additionally, Tabelog provides an awesome list called "The Tabelog Award". It helps you to find some of the best places to eat and drink around the city. The following links are from Tabelog.

## To event organizers :raised_hands:

The purpose of curating something in Tokyo is to help people find great places to eat and hack because we could not find these things easily when we attended foreign conferences before. We would like to help a lot of people have safe and fun travel throughout the curated list. On the other hand, the list is not enough because we cannot customize it for each conference, but we think you may not want to create the list from scratch, so we prepare following steps to do it. Have a fun!

1. Fork the project.
2. Change name for your event. E.g. `awesome-nodefest-2017`
3. Customize forked list :sparkles: :
   + Add venues address
   + List hotels near venues
