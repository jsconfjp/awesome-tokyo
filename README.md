## Mobile Wifi/SIM

Japan has a strong mobile internet network, and for tourist use it is possible to get both tourist SIM cards as well as rent mobile Wifi boxes. You can either pick up at the airport and/or preorder it to be sent to your Hotel.

## To event organizers :raised_hands:

The purpose of curating something in Tokyo is to help people find great places to eat and hack because we could not find these things easily when we attended foreign conferences before. We would like to help a lot of people have safe and fun travel throughout the curated list. On the other hand, the list is not enough because we cannot customize it for each conference, but we think you may not want to create the list from scratch, so we prepare following steps to do it. Have a fun!

1. Fork the project.
2. Change name for your event. E.g. `awesome-jsconf-2020`
3. Customize forked list :sparkles: :
   + Add venues address
   + List hotels near venues
